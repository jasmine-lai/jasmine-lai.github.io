      <p>
        Hey! I'm Jasmine. I'm originally from Boston, Massachusetts. I graduated from Northeastern University in 2024 with a B.S. in Computer Science 
        and I plan on completing a M.S. in Computer Science in 2025.
        <br/><br/>
        Within the realm of computer science, I'm primarily interested in software development. 
        I value writing scalable and maintainable code, especially for large systems.
        <br/><br/>
        When I'm not coding, catch me at a bouldering gym, playing Genshin Impact, or vibing at a rave!
        <br/><br/>
