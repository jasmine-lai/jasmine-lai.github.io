            my name is jasmine lai. i'm from acton, ma, but currently living in boston. i'm a second-year student at
            northeastern university studying computer science. i've always been excited about working in a 
            development field and pushing the boundaries of society, especially technology.
            <br>
            <br>here are some of my interests outside of academics: 
            <br>i've been figure skating since i was 6 years old. i competed recreationally in high school and 
            at the collegiate level during my first year at northeastern. these days, skating is more of
            a fun and nostalgic personal hobby rather than a competitive goal, but i still return the rink every so 
            often to practice.
            <br>i enjoy going hiking all-year round (check out my hiking photos on the misc page!). i mostly hike 
            in the white mountains in new hampshire, but i'd hike all around the world given the opportunity. 
            my dream is to hike in patagonia. to date, i've completed the AMC list of 48 4000-footer 
            mountains in the whites, as well as the presidential traverse. i also completed the tour du mont blanc
            (TMB) in july 2022.
            <br>i love to travel. i think that learning about other countries' history and culture is an important
            aspect of life. i've been to 26 countries and 26 states in the US. my top three favorite countries are 
            norway, iceland, and switzerland.5
            <br>i enjoy snowboarding in the winter. my favorite peaks would have to be at vail, colorado and 
            park city, utah. i also recently got into bouldering at local gyms with friends.
            <br>i'm an avid genshin impact fan! i'm really curious about the development of the game, from the roadmap
            for the entire game to the process of implementing new features for each patch. genshin has also 
            inspired me to start creating music again (i used to play piano in high school).
