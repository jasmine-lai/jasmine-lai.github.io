        <p>
            Hi! i'm Jasmine. I'm from Acton, MA, but currently living in Boston. I'm a second-year student at
            Northeastern University studying computer science. I've always been excited about working in a 
            development field and pushing the boundaries of society, especially technology. Some of my favorite 
            activities outside of academics are figure skating, hiking, bouldering, snowboarding, and travel. 
            I also enjoy playing casual video games such as Genshin Impact. My favorite book is The Martian 
            by Andy Weir, and my favorite show is The Expanse.
