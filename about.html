            Hi! I'm Jasmine. I'm a second-year student at Northeastern University studying computer science. 
            I've always been excited about working in a development field and pushing the boundaries of society, 
            especially in technology. Some of my favorite activities outside of academics are figure skating, 
            hiking, bouldering, snowboarding, and travel. I also enjoy playing casual video games such as Genshin Impact. 
            My favorite book is The Martian by Andy Weir, and my favorite show is The Expanse.
